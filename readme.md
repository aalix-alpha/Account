# Getting Started

Though python is very popular language and  
a general purpose language which was developed in 1989, but it is not that fast as c++/c.  

That's why I decided to move to a brand new language  
**_Julia_**

Julia was developed in 2012 and it is as easy as python and fast as C/C++.
